# Key-Value store

This is a primary/backup RPC-based key-value store written in OCaml using async concurrency library.

The design and some of the code is based on lab 2 of MIT's Distributed Systems class (6.824, Spring 2015). More details on the [class website](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2015/labs/lab-2.html) and a previous [implementation in golang](https://github.com/phlalx/key-value-store). See also some [RPC examples](https://bitbucket.org/yminsky/core-hello-world).
